	abstract = {I estimate the impact of social networks on voters' knowledge about their congressional representatives; on voter turnout and incumbency advantage; on the correspondent responsiveness of their representatives; and, ultimately, on the level of federal funding constituents receive. I exploit the mismatch between congressional district borders and underlying social networks, and I construct the share of each county's Facebook friends that are in the same congressional district as the county, which I refer to as "congruence." I use redistricting events and county fixed effects to uncover the impact of congruence while controlling for facotrs that may affect the network structure. I show that voters in counties that have on average a higher share of Facebook friends in their own congressional district are more likely to report having heard of their House representative and to correctly choose their representative's party.  Turnout rates in House elections are higher in these counties, and the incumbency advantage is stronger for their representatives.},

	langid = {english},

	abstract ={In a world where the majority and the minority group have equal distributions of talent, where candidates are objectively and accurately evaluated, and no discrimination occurs, the underrepresentation of the minority group in prestigious positions is nonethless highly sticky. The reasons are intuitive. If the sample of candidates from the minority group is numerically smaller, at equal distribution of talent, the most qualified candidate is more likely to belong to the majority sample, mirroring its larger numerical size. If future samples of candidates respond to the realized selection in the expected direction–increasing if the selection came from the sample, decreasing or increasing less if it did not–the higher probability of success in the majority sample will persist. We capture this process with a well-known statistical model: the Polya urn. The richness of existing results and the streamlined model allow us to study and compare different policy interventions. A simple app (https://caron.shinyapps.io/Women-Men-Polya-Urns/) allows readers to run their own experiments. Two robust results are that temporary affirmative actions interventions have long -term equalizing effects, and that any decline in the quality of selected candidates is self-correcting, even while the intervention lasts.},
