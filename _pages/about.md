Welcome! I am a 6th-year Economics PhD candidate at Columbia University. I am on the job market in 2024-2025. I am interested in topics related to political economy, social networks, and public economics. I use both lab experiments and tools from applied microeconomics. I served as the Lab Manager for the <a href = "https://celss.iserp.columbia.edu/">Columbia Experimental Laboratory for Social Sciences</a> in 2023.

Prior to Columbia, I did a Pre-Doctoral Fellowship with UChicago's Harris School. I received my B.A. in Economics and in Public Policy from UChicago in 2016.

My CV is <a href = "./assets/pdf/cv.pdf">here</a>.
