Welcome! For the 2025-2026 academic year, I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago's 
[Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and 
[Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/). 
I will be joining the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/cas/economics) as an Assistant Professor in the 
Department of Economics in August 2025 and will begin teaching there in August 2026.

My research interests lie in political economy, social networks, and public economics. 
I use both lab experiments and tools from applied microeconomics.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University in May 2025, and my B.A. in Economics and Public Policy from 
UChicago in 2016. My CV is <a href = "./assets/pdf/cv.pdf">here</a>.
